# Decentralized Healthcare Provider Credentialing

This project implements a blockchain-based credentialing system for healthcare providers that streamlines verification processes, reduces administrative burden, and ensures trust in provider qualifications. The platform creates a secure, immutable record of healthcare practitioner credentials that can be efficiently shared across institutions.

## Core Components

1. **Provider Identity Contract**
    - Manages secure digital identities for healthcare practitioners
    - Stores cryptographically signed identifying information
    - Links practitioners to their verified credentials and privileges
    - Supports privacy-preserving sharing of identity information

2. **Qualification Verification Contract**
    - Validates medical degrees, certifications, and training
    - Creates immutable record of educational achievements
    - Connects directly with accredited institutions for verification
    - Tracks continuing education requirements and fulfillment

3. **Hospital Privileging Contract**
    - Tracks approved procedures and practice rights by institution
    - Records peer reviews and clinical performance evaluations
    - Manages expiration dates and renewal processes
    - Enables rapid privileging verification during emergency situations

4. **Insurance Panel Contract**
    - Manages participation in insurance networks and payment systems
    - Validates proper credentialing for reimbursement eligibility
    - Streamlines provider enrollment in multiple insurance programs
    - Creates audit trail of network participation history
